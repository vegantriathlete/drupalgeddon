drupalgeddon
============

Compilation of resources for remediating / dealing with the Drupal 7.x SQL injection vulnerability

Note: I am not the one who came up with the name drupalgeddon and I don't intend to infringe on that namespace.
I just needed to quickly come up with a good name that people would recognize.
There is a [project on drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalgeddon) that came up with that name.
My apologies to [the](https://www.drupal.org/u/xurizaemon) [maintainers](https://www.drupal.org/u/fluxsauce) and all the [contributors](https://www.drupal.org/node/2359843/committers).
I am happy to create a new repo if they take issue with this name.
